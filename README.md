Did you know that after water and tea, beer is one of the most widely consumed drinks in the world?
Unsurprisingly, it is also one of the world's oldest alcoholic drinks -- humans have been making and enjoying beer for generations and generations. Current findings suggest that the first beer brewers were the ==Sumerians=={Q35355} around 4,000 BCE. This was evident from excavations of ancient ==Mesopotamia=={Q11767}, which uncovered tablets depicting villagers drinking a mysterious beverage from a bowl with straws as well as odes to ==Ninkasi=={Q1088421}, their patron goddess of beer and brewing.

Hilariously, even though beer was present within the Roman era, the Romans themselves were not very found of beer. In comparison with wine, which they believed to be a "civilised" drink -- they considered beer to drink of the "rustic" and "common". To put it simply, wine was for the elite and "cultured" and beer was for the lowly "barbarous". Luckily for us, the Romans' distaste for beer did not stop it from spreading across the empire through travels, trade, and happenstance.

Beers come in all sorts of different flavours and colours. From light and fruity to dark and creamy, there's a type of beer for every kind of human. Historically, what we know as "beer" has been made from various kinds of cereal grains such as malted barely and wheat through the calculated brewing and fermentation. At times, even oats, rice, and even corn were added to recipes in to create new taste experiences. Nowadays, the sky is truly the limit! As micro-brewies continue to pop-up on every corner, along come more innovative flavour additions. Pickles. Ghost pepper chilis. Cookies and cream. Almost anything goes. The same experimental joy comes from the addition to more alcohol-free options to breweries' line-ups. 

There's much to be said about the manner in which beer is served, different places and cultures have their own, sometimes even controversial rules. Ice cold. Room temperature. Ice. No ice. Abundant frothy head. It's all relative. 
Nevertheless, whether you're pouring out a beer for your loved ones, ancestor's at a shrine, or even your boss -- be sure to drink up and enjoy!
